					Most resources for learning something new (like coding) are made by
					people doing a retrospective on how they learned. They give you advice
					and resources about what helped them, and in many ways, that is
					incredibly helpful.
				</p>
				<p>
					I always thought it would be interesting to document my journey
					learning something completely new, but there had never been any topic
					I was interesting in pursuing from the beginning. I wanted to explain
					my process, document my successes and failures, have a repository of
					work done, as well as have it all time boxed.

					Recently, I found myself incredibly interested in the world of game
					development. More specifically, I started watching videos about VR
					Chat and the different ways that they built features and technology
					that people really loved. I have always wanted to build technology
					that really spoke to people, and I thought that building in VR, more
					specifically in the vein of VR Chat, could be something I would really
					enjoy. So, with that idea, I started gathering resources to start
					learning.

				<p>
					This blog will act as a way to keep me accountable for learning and
					staying on schedule. It will act as a repository for my projects. It
					will
