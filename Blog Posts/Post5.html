                <p>What's the end goal?</p>
                <p>Sometimes I get caught up in the end goal during the process of learning something new. I get 10 steps ahead when I should be focusing on what's immediately in front of me. This mindset can sometimes be helpful, but most of the time it just leads to a frustration and dissatisfaction with where I am right now, which is bad.</p>
                <p>That being said, there's nothing wrong with being prepared, and that's what I am here to do.</p>
                <hr /> 
                <p>Depending on where you are in your journey (I imagine it's the beginning if you are reading this) you might start thinking "Well, what am I going to do with these new skills?". You may have come into it with an idea of what you liked. Maybe you like to create, maybe you love video games, whatever it is, I imagine that you would like to be able to do that full time.</p>
                <p>Initially, when I started teaching myself software development, I thought that getting a job "in development" was going to be pretty straightforward, but it wasn't.</p>
                <p>There were a whole host of qualification, languages to understand, hoops to jump through, and this was a shock to me. I just thought we needed to know "how to code" but it turned out to be much more than that.</p>
                <p>So, I figured near the beginning of this journey, I would start to get an understanding for what companies are looking for, not only for me, but for anyone reading this!</p>
                <p>Here is an Sheets document that outlines jobs that I find that are interesting. I am hoping we can use this to help better focus our efforts when we get to that job searching point.</p>

            <p>Feel free to add to this document.</p>
<hr/>
<p>I hope that as this document grows, it can be helpful in all of making that next leap.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
