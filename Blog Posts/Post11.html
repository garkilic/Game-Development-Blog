			<h2>My Brain Doesn't Work</h2>
			<p>Date: Nov. 14th, 2022</p>
			<div class="blog-body">
                <p>I feel like my brain has been living in some primordial fluid over the past week. Just kind of floating around, not capable of much. Not to make it sound like I have been doing nothing, I have been doing a ton, I have just been incredibly tired.</p>
                <p>I honestly don't know how people are able to juggle all of these responsibilities (work, hobbies, exercise, etc.) and that's just as a 25 year old. I don't even have that many things to worry about and I am already tired.</p>
                <p>This past week I focused on a lot of things that were not development. I took a bit of a break to relax my brain. I focused on other endeavours, ran a lot, explored new opportunities, watched videos about VR, it was a nice week.</p>
                <p>I focused a lot of what's going on in the Crypto space actually. I never really "Got" what crypto or Web3 was about (not for a lack of trying), and now that it's all coming down in terms of frozen withdrawals and FTX going from "liquid" to bankrupt in a matter of days, I cannot say I am surprised. It really bums me out that for these silly technologies to crash that real people have to suffer the consequences. </p>
                <p>I think this post will act more as a time capsule then something to learn from and follow.</p>
