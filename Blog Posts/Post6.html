			<h2>Comparisons and Social Media</h2>
			<p>Date: Oct. 10th, 2022</p>
			<div class="blog-body">
				<p>
					Some days I feel good, and some days I don't. Today is a good day.
				</p>
				<p>
					I am on a road trip right now traveling up the Oregon Coast with my
					partner, Anna. We had been feeling stuck both mentally and physically
					in The Bay for awhile and we decided, rather quickly, to take a
					roadtrip to check out more of the West Coast that we had never seen.
				</p>
				<p>
					It seemed that right as we got on the 1 and I started seeing trees I
					felt a weight lifted off of me. I think when you are stuck and have
					anxiety, it can be easy to feel like everything is so pressing and
					important. It may be universal, but especially in the Bay Area it can
					feel like there is nothing more important than a career, then
					technology, then constantly wondering how you are ever going to afford
					a house.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is partly due to the area. There are a lot of amazing things
					about living in Oakland, but there are an equal amount of issues, and
					this balance can lead to a love/hate relationship. It is also
					attributed to the culutre which seems to be emphasized by social media
					like LinkedIn.
				</p>
				<p>
					I will admit something to you, I am a recovering "hustle culture"
					addict. I was not spouting nothingburgers to motivate you, but I
					definitley pushed myself harder than I should, and I will partly
					attribute that to the toxic productivity of the internet. I will also
					admit that I relapse sometimes. When I have free time I refresh my
					email and my LinkedIn hoping for... something. Maybe it's validation.
					Maybe it's the excitement of the potenital of something new (new job,
					new career, new person to talk to). This is not something I want to
					do, but I do it anyway.
				</p>
				<p>
					I find it kind of crazy that I can know how these social media systems
					work and still I get sucked into it. I have blockers on my phone, my
					computer, and still, I fall down these rabbit-holes reading some awful
					content.
				</p>
				<p>
					The truth is, I am a sucker for validation. I look at reviews for
					anything I purchase, for any meal or resteraunt I go to, and for any
					path (career or otherwise) that I take. I want to be reassured again
					and again that I am doing the right thing.
				</p>
				<p>I don't want to be this way.</p>
				<p>
					The reason I talk about these issues, is because right as I some some
					Redwoods and got to the ocean, I felt better. It reminded me that none
					of that stuff really matters. I felt more confident, more sure of
					myself than I had in a long time.
				</p>
				<p>
					This made me realize that this is how I want be all the time. Not that
					it's entirely possible for me to move to the Redwoods (although that
					is kind of the plan eventually), but I can take steps to get away from
					the constant validation.
				</p>
				<p>Here's the plan:</p>
				<ul class="list">
					<li class="list-item">
						No more LinkedIn or HackerNews. It will be super-blocked on all of
						my devices.
					</li>
					<li class="list-item">
						No more looking up reviews. Just try it out and see what happens.
					</li>
					<li class="list-item">
						Avoid any career-related content. I love what I am doing with my
						development journey and I know it's the right path. I don't need
						anyone else confirming or disagreeing with my path.
					</li>
					<li class="list-item">No more social media.</li>
					<li>
						No more asking people what they thing (to a degree) and just making
						a decision.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					This is me making a pledge to anyone reading this. I will be better.
				</p>

					As usual, thanks for reading. This blog has helped focus my thoughts
					and the progress I have made and people that have talked to me about
					this journey have been a huge inspiration.
				</p>
				<p>Thanks everyone.</p>
