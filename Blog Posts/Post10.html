			<h2>Beginning The Work</h2>
			<p>Date: Nov. 7th, 2022</p>
			<div class="blog-body">
                <p>I feel like I am getting this. I finally feel like I can go out on my own and build what's in my head (albeit with a ton of Googling), and that's an awesome feeling.</p>
                <p>It's weird, sometimes I feel like I am at the beginning of something and sometimes I feel like I am banging my head against the wall. I love to do this stuff, but it feels like it's not leading anywhere (or I will never get there).</p>
                <p>It's such a bummer I feel this way because the work that I am putting into this is actually really fun. Maybe that's a part of the problem, so far in my life I have trudged through things that aren't fun in my job, in my life, because I thought I had too, and now it feels like it's too late. Or maybe you have to do that stuff you don't like to figure out what you want to do.</p>
                <p>All of this to say, I wish I could work on this stuff all day. I know some people make games for a living, but it feels like the dream like becoming a famous actor is a dream or sailing the world is a dream. But even as I write that I realize how silly it is because those dreams are 100x bigger then "spend all day building games". There are tons of developers, I know a lot of them, some are even self-taught. If they can do it, why can't I?</p>\
                <p>When I talk about this with other people they talk about the bigger picture, which makes sense (from an outside perspective). I think it's the day-to-day, the incrememntal learning, the lack of concrete path, that makes it difficult.</p>
                <p>Something that's on my mind, just wanted to talk about it somewhere</p>
                <p>TL;DR: Some days good, some days bad.</p>
                <hr />
                <p>In other news: I planned out my first project. I am giving myself a month to build a demo/idea I had.</p>
                <p>I am currently building the level structure and writing the script.</p>
                <p>The gameplay should be relatively simple, but in this case that's alright. I think the most significant pieces will be the AI coding (which I know nothing about).</p>
                <p>Looking forward to posting about it more here. When I am finished I will have a link to the game, the script, and a blog post taking a retrospective approach to my first game.</p>
