			<h2>Experiences</h2>
			<p>Date: Oct. 17th, 2022</p>
			<div class="blog-body">
				<p>I have been on an adventure this past week.</p>
                <p>I mentioned it in my previous blog post, but last week I was on a roadtrip from Oakland to Portland to Seattle and Olympic National Park.</p>
                <p>When you are on the road, it's difficult to keep up the coding practice. Sure, I thought about it a lot, but it's not like I was actively working on my game or anything, and I think that's alrgiht.</p>
                <p>Typical discourse around learning anything new whether it's a new game engine or an exercise program is that typical advice requires full committment. No breaks, no deviations, and if, for some reason you miss a day (or a week) then that is a failure. Also, just the general idea that "learning" is just doing the thing.</p>
                <p>I find that coding and building software is everything you would expect. It's theory-based, complex, often times perplexing, but when you get past that you find that there's a level of creativity needed, which is a long way of getting to the point of this blog post.</p>
                <p>Creativity, in part (and my opinion) is fueled by new experiences, opinions, and ideas. I think it's incredibly important to seek the new, and you will be surprised by how much that shifts what you build.</p>
                <p>Maybe this whole post is a sub-concious justification for taking a week off and not working. Maybe it's not, I will let you be the judge.</p>
                <p>I guess what I am trying to say is that it's good to take breaks. This is not something I have ever been good at, so maybe this is a good place to start.</p>
