            <h2>A Total Beginner</h2>
            <p>Date: Sept. 2, 2022</p>
            <div class="blog-body">
                <p>I am writing this from an empty room in my office at work.</p>
                <p>I probably should not be working on my blog during "office hours" but I am banking on no one from my office actually reading this.</p>
                <p>So, why am I writing this during the time when I should be "working"? It might be because there is a signifcant lull in actual work to be done right now. Or, for the sake of the narrative of this blog, it's because I can't get my mind off of this project.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>Let me backtrack before I get to into this whole project.</p>
                <p>Before this year, I never thought about game development in a meaningful way. I love video games, but not in a way you would attribute to a game developer "wunderkind", more like your average Gen Z, male, in his 20's. I typically play FPS, RTS, and Rouge-like games in the hours when I am not working, running, or cooking, but it felt more like a pastime then a calling.</p>
                <p>Over the past year I saw two videos that opened my eyes to the magic of game development and a world I could fall deep into. These two videos were: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Video 1</li>
                    <li>Video 2</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These two videos opened my eyes to the world of VR. Not the vision being sold to you by books like 'Ready Player One' or Meta, but the idea that VR could be a game changer to those of us who don't fit into traditional society. Furthermore, VR creates the opportunity to build worlds and spaces that are impossible to access currently. There is a whole world of experiences and games that can be built and I want to be one of the people that builds them.</p>
                <p>Don't get me wrong, I am not some VR fanatic. I haven't been a vocal proponent of the technology, and most VR headsets make me seasick, but I think there's a spark of something really special here. <br/> <strong>But, there's one problem...</strong></p>
                <h2>I don't know how to build anything for VR, I don't know "game theory", and I don't know what to build.</h2>
                <p>But I know what I can do, start learning.</p>
                <br />
                <p>Which is how we get back to the reasoning behind this blog.</p>
                <p>I wanted to document my path towards learning something new. I had watched videos about people looking back and talking about what they had done, but that always felt kind of lame. Everything makes sense looking back, but most of the time, it doesn't make sense in the moment.</p>
                <p>So, the goal here is to create a respository of my journey towards learning game development, act as a judge and reccomender (is that a word?) of online resources, and potentially be an inspiration for others who want to learn something new.</p>
                <p>I hope I can do this.</p>
                <h2>The Rules</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>For the next 365 days, work on learning Unity, C#, and other languages/tools I might need. The goal is to set aside at least 8 hours a week to work on this.</li>
                    <li>Every week on Monday I will write and release a blog post here on my blog documenting what I have been working on as well as talk about whatever else I want (it's my blog, I can do that).</li>
                    <li>As I find resources I will add them to the resources section with a rating.</li>
                    <li>As I build projects, they will be available in the 'Portfolio' section.</li>
                </ol>
                <h2>Final Additions:</h2>
                <p>This website will continue to be updated with both content and functionality. Right now, it's pretty light on the actual features I want it to have, so I will work on building those as well, don't worry.</p>
                <p>To be clear, this is about building games and VR projects. Not that it's mutually exclusive, just wanted to clarify here because I will probably use them interchangably.</p>
                <p>Finally, thanks for reading. You could be reading a bunch of other blogs right now, and you are reading mine, thanks!</p>
