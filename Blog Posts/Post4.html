			<h2>Learning New Things</h2>
			<p>Date: Sept. 26th, 2022</p>
			<div class="blog-body">
				<p>It may seem like anyone writing a blog like this must love the process of learning. Or maybe it doesn't. I honestly don't know who the type of person is that reads a blog like this is like, let alone what they think about the author. But, the truth of the matter, learning has never been something that has interested me.</p>
                <p>For the most part, since I was in Middle School I did not like school. I sat in class and wondered where the motivation to learn that seemed so apparent in my peers was coming from. From that point on, learning new things, math, writing, grammar, all seemed like a means to an end. Do well in Middle and High School and then you will be able to go to a good College and work on something you are really interested in (or so I thought). That was about as far as my brain got.</p>
                <p>There were things that I loved. I loved to write. I loved Theater. I was good at it. I did it every chance I got. But, I was encouraged to pursue STEM. Writing and Theater were just a hobby, not something I could do full time. It was definitley not something people went to College for, or so I was told.</p>
                <p>So, I did alright in High School, got good enough grades, good GPA, good SAT scores, and got into College for STEM, and basically left Theater and Writing behind.</p>
                <p>While I loved my College experience I ran into the same problem that I had in school before. Nothing really interested me, but I took the classes anyway. I switched majors. Took on a minor. Nothing made me more excited about school and I figured that this was what learning would be like.</p>
                <p>It wasn't until I started designing apps in my free time that I started to feel a spark of interest. It was the same spark I felt when I was writing. I was creating again, and it felt awesome.</p>
                <p>I started building teams. Trying to raise money. Getting a name in the entrepreneurship community in San Luis Obispo. It was awesome.</p>
                <p>After some startups, I started as a product manager at a startup in LA, where I was able to work with actual tech professionals. I found that out of all the parts of a startup I was most drawn to the engineering department. I thought it was amazing that these people could create an app from nothing. I didn't know a ton about what it meant to code, but the people I worked with were incredibly encouraging, and they got me interested.</p>
                <p>I won't say that I started learning to code immediately but it was that same spark. But, once again, I was discouraged from pursuing it. It seems silly to think that out of all the things, one would be discouraged from coding. Open LinkedIn at any time and you will see hundreds of people shouting that you must learn to code (stupid).</p>
                <p>It's easy to say, from the outside looking in, "you should have just done it, who cares", but it was really difficult. I had been on this path for so long it felt like I couldn't do anything else but Product Management. I know that sounds silly, but I think a lot of people can relate to that feeling of being stuck.</p>
                <p>So, long story short, after tons of encouragements from engineer friends, I started to learn web development.</p>
                <p>This is when it clicked. This is why people like to learn. I felt like my brain was working again.</p>
                <p>I read somewhere that being "passionate" about something is when you can't help but do whatever that passion is. It takes up space in your brain that you have to act upon, and that's how I feel now.</p>
                <p>I think about game development and programming basically all day. I read books about game theory. Sketch out ideas. Make MVPs. Watch videos on it. And, I finally don't care where it leads.</p>
                <hr />
                <p>This was a bit of a therapy session for me than it was a blog about game development but I wanted to get it off my chest because other people might relate, and that's what this blog is for.</p>
                <p>I am not anyone special and you don't have to be either.</p>
                <hr />
                <p>Last week I said I was going to write about my game idea but this week I got a little side-tracked with work and personal things, so this blog does not include that.</p>
                <p>That being said, I am definitley working on things and I can't wait to update y'all soon.</p>
                <p>If you are reading this, thank you.</p>
