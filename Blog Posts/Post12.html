			<h2>I missed you.</h2>
			<p>Date: Nov. 28th, 2022</p>
			<div class="blog-body">
               <p>I feel like I always hit this point with blogging. It's fun when it's easy and the words flow effortlessly but a little bit more difficult when I get busy or distracted.</p>
               <p>That being said I did miss writing here (I only missed one week, but still).</p>
               <p>A lot has happened since I wrote last.</p>
               <p>I got a new job which I am incredibly excited about.</p>
               <p>Anna got me a VR headset which is even crazier than I expected it to be.</p>
               <p>Just a ton of good stuff has been happening which is just the best.</p>
               <p>I want to write about more of this in detail, and I will, but not this week.</p>
               <p>I feel like it's been hard to write in depth blog posts every week. Most of my posts aren't even about development, which I think is fine, but still, I want what I write to be more in depth.</p>
               <p>So, moving forward, I am going to have more focused blog posts that I will write every two weeks. I imagine I will maintain this informal tone, but I want these "blog coversations" to be more technical. I want to writing here to help make the information more concrete, not just be a place for my rambling, so that's what I will be going for.</p>
               <p>My next post will be Dec. 12th, so look out for that post!</p>
               <p>Thanks for reading and staying up to date.</p>
               <p>Thanks for reminding me to write, Blaine.</p>
               <p>Cheers.
               </p>
