			<h2>Silly Mistakes</h2>
			<p>Date: Sept. 11, 2022</p>
			<div class="blog-body">
				<p>
					Coding is a balance of love and hate, genius and idiotic,
					simple-minded and prophetic. Some days when I am building something it
					all seems to click. Everything I write seems to work and all of my
					practice and knowledge seems to click into place. Other days I cannot
					center a div or fix a simple error. This week I had a mistake that is
					a little embarrassing to write about.
				</p>
				<hr />
				<p>
					Let me explain this lapse in judgement so you can avoid this same
					mistake.
				</p>
				<hr />
				<p>
					When it comes to text editors, there are many options, but for a lot
					of people Visual Studio Code is the obvious choice. It is relatively
					simple, maintained by Microsoft, free, and has a ton of useful
					extensions for cleaner and better code.
				</p>
				<p>
					When you start working in Unity you will eventually have to get into
					scripting (just as I did this week) and you will have to choose a
					text-editor to work within when writing C# or Javascript for your
					game. I, of course, used Visual Studio Code because it's the text
					editor I use all the time.
				</p>
				<p>
					I noticed something was off immediately. I was writing C# (something I
					just started) but the Unity Intellisense was not working.
					"Intellisense" is basically auto-complete functionality specific to
					Unity/Game Development practices. It's incredibly helpful in this
					instance because there are a ton of Unity-specific components and
					functions you may not know off the top of your head but are incredibly
					important. It also helps because C# is incredibly literal. If you miss
					on "()" or ";" or capital letter, your game will not work.
				</p>
				<p>All of this to say that Intellisense is important.</p>
				<p>
					I kid you not when I say that I spent hours trying to get this
					working. I watched Youtube videos, read forum posts about this
					specific issue, downloaded extensions, I did everything I could think
					of. I could not figure it out. I was lost and figured that this was
					just not going to be available for my journey.
				</p>
				<p>
					Yesterday, I decided, "fuck it" I am going to solve this, and on the
					first video I watched it clicked and my brain broke.
				</p>
				<p>
					You see, there is Visual Studio Code, which I and a ton of other
					developers use, but, for some unknown reason there is also
					<em>Visual Studio</em>, a completely different text editor used for
					more complex applications, also maintained by Microsoft with a
					frustratingly similar logo.
				</p>
				<p>
					That's right, I was using the wrong editor, for a week, trying to
					solve this impossible problem.
				</p>
				<p>
					I felt so dumb that I questioned not only my coding abilities but my
					sanity.
				</p>
				<hr />
				<p>
					At the end of the day it's not a huge deal, I figured it out, and I
					was happy that I did because Intellisense now works. But, as you go on
					this adventure, especially if you aren't a professional developer,
					learn to be okay with the fact that days you will feel like a genius
					and other days you will feel like a monkey trying to write
					Shakespeare.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you want a book that covers these feelings and the general life and
					feelings of a programmer I would suggest a book called 'Coders' by
					Clive Thompson. He perfectly captures this feeling because it's
					universal in this field.
				</p>
				<hr />
				<p>
					One more story before I finish this post. Yesterday I was playing
					video games with a friend. He asked what I was working on and I sent
					him this site.
				</p>
				<p>"What's this timer mean?" he asked.</p>
				<p>"It's the amount of time I gave myself to learn this"</p>
				<p>"Why are you wasting it here playing games with me?" he said.</p>
				<p>...</p>
				<hr />
				<p>Ah, the power of the countdown.</p>
				<p>Until next week...</p>
