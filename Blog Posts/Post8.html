			<h2>Trying</h2>
			<p>Date: Oct. 24th, 2022</p>
			<div class="blog-body">
				<p>
					I don't know what I thought this blog was going to be when I started
					it. I think that I was hoping it would be more technical. So far that
					does not to appear the case.
				</p>
				<p>
					I am still working on stuff though, the VR dream is not dead. Almost
					every day I am working on one project or another. This past week I
					finished the Unity Fundamentals course which taught me about sound
					design, assets, and physics.
				</p>
				<p>
					I am closer to my goals than I was last week, but some days it doesn't
					feel like it. I try to be positive but some days the reality of
					becoming a VR developer (or working in the space) seems farther and
					farther away. Some days I don't even know if it's what I want to do.
				</p>
				<p>
					Don't get me wrong, I love what I am building, I love my projects,
					working in Unity, even the VR space itself, I just get lost in what
					the end result is, and maybe that's the problem. Maybe I should stop
					focusing on that. I know I should stop worrying in general (if only it
					were that easy) but I get bogged down in the details.
				</p>
				<p>
					As I write now, my head gets clearer. That's probably my favorite part
					about this blog, that it's a judgement free place to put my thoughts.
					Maybe it doesn't matter this blog and journey isn't what I thought it
					was going to be. It's not to late to change it, or keep refining it.
				</p>
				<p>
					That should be the lesson to take away from this, that it's not too
					late. I am working on something I genuinely love and that is a huge
					accomplishment.
				</p>
				<h2>What Did I Accomplish This Week?</h2>
				<ul class="list">
					<li class="list-item">Completed the Unity Essentials Course</li>

				</ul>
				<h2>What Am I Stuck On?</h2>
				<ul class="list">
					<ul class="list">
						<li class="list-item">
							Still stuck on the computer science fundamentals. I cannot find a
							compelling way to learn this stuff.
						</li>
						<li class="list-item">
							I am having difficulty organizing my time.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Talk next week,</p>
