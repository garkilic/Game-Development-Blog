			<h2>Staying Consistent</h2>
			<p>Date: Sept. 19th, 2022</p>
			<div class="blog-body">
				<p>
					I have always wished that I was the type of person who could pursue a
					goal doggedly. You know the type. The person that can just work and
					work obsessively. That's just not me.
				</p>
				<p>
					Maybe this type of person doesn't really exist. Even if they did
					exist, I am sure it's not the way it is in the movies and books. You
					see, in movies, they tend to cut out all of the boring stuff that real
					life contains (imagine if they didn't, sheesh).
				</p>
				<p>
					All of this to say, don't beat yourself up (like I do (and shouldn't))
					regarding working hard enough. I want to take the approach that any
					progress is good regardless if you can spend an hour or ten hours a
					week working on this.
				</p>
				<hr />
				<p>So what was accomplished in the last week?</p>
				<p>
					Well, I finished my first simple game. I followed along on the
					Brackeys tutorial (posted on this site in the
					<a href="../Pages/Resources.html">resources</a> section, and I gotta
					tell you, it was a great feeling.
				</p>
				<p>
					One of the reasons why I love this type of development so much is
					because there is immediate feedback and it's so literal. As a web
					developer, you can write code, and it may work but it may not work
					well, there are hacky things you can do, but Javascript is finiky and
					web development can sometimes (most of the time) make me want to bang
					my head against a wall.
				</p>
				<p>
					When it comes to game development though, you already have a game
					engine (Unity) so you have a lot already to work with. Put on top of
					that C# (which is what I use, but you could use JS if you are a
					masochist) which is just fails even if you are missing a ; or a
					capital letter, it's awesome.
				</p>
				<p>
					Honestly, that's part of the reason why I loved math so much. Either
					it works or it doesn't, it's a 0 or a 1. Love it or hate it, either
					the answer is right or wrong. (Don't come at me math people, the
					metaphor doesn't extend very far, whatever).
				</p>
				<p>
					What I am trying to say is that I made my first game and game
					development is fun.
				</p>
				<hr />
				<p>
					Following game #1 will be game #2 which will also be following a
					tutorial (also linked in Resources), after that I will be on my own
					and building my game from scratch.
				</p>
				<p>
					This type of learning isn't for everyone, but I know what helps me is
					an introduction to a subject with a lot of small wins. After those
					small wins I throw myself into the deep end and figure it out (with
					the bit of knowledge I gained). Then I will Google and study until I
					complete whatever the project is.
				</p>
				<p>
					Next week, I will present my first game idea in more detail so I have
					a repository of my ideas (and to fill you in). But for now, this is
					the update.
				</p>
				<p>Keep it up and we will talk again soon.</p>
