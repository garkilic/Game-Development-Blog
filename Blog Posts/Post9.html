			<h2>Catching Up</h2>
			<p>Date: Oct. 31st, 2022</p>
			<div class="blog-body">
			<p>Why is it so easy to feel busy? Some weeks I feel like the week drags by, I feel like every day is a struggle. However, for the past three weeks I feel like every instant of time I have is taken up by something. That happens when you work in an office, but even in my free time, I feel like I am working on projects or reading or playing video games with friends.</p>
            <p>Let me be clear, I like this feeling. I feel like my brain works best when I am constantly noodling on a problem. So these past few weeks have been great, but I feel like I have both been super productive and not productive at all.</p>
            <p>In terms of VR, I have gotten deeper into C# and it's applications in Unity. Unity is such a cool platform, being able to change anything whether it's physics or movement, or text pop-ups, working in a game engine is fun.</p>
            <p>On top of that, I have been exploring game design. I am currently reading "A Theory of Fun for Game Design" and there have been a ton of interesting tidbits.</p>
            <p>Something from 'Theory of Fun' that really spoke to me was around the idea of gamification.</p>
            <p>After working in mobile apps for five years, the "term" gamification gives me something akin to PTSD flashbacks. In my experience, "Gamification" has been a term used to by companies to figure out how to "trick" people into doing something. They use badges, points, awards, "communities", all with the idea of keeping people "engaged". This is especially pertinent in subscription-based applications. The idea is that you want to keep a customer around as long as possible, so they keep paying a subscription, so you can keep the lights on. It also goes a little deeper (I could go all day), engagement as a model for growth has become a mainstay in the startup world. On it's surface you want to keep people engaged, but from what I have seen, engagement isn't about creating a great product, it's about creating feedback loops that keep people engaged in <strong>your product</strong> and not neccessarily what problem you are solving.</p>
            <p>So, what does this have to do with gamification and 'Theory of Fun'?</p>
            <p>Well, 'Theory of Fun' posits that gamification is only effective as long as the underlying act is fun. For example, take a fitness app (a space I have spent a significant amount of time in), traditionally gamification is used to encourage people to exercise more using the fitness app (if you do 3 workouts you get a badge etc.). But, what this ignores is the main meat of the app, the actual fitness. Traditional gamification ignores this part, they are only concerned with what happens before or after (in terms of rewards) because the assumption is that exercise is not fun. But why not? 'Theory of Fun' stresses the importance of having a fun "base" and then gamification only adds to that.</p>
            <p>Take another example. Imagine a game that has all the "gamification" components you could think of. Badges, rewards, "atta-boys". But imagine that the main game wasn't fun. If it had an unrewarding feedback loop (resource looting for hours on end with little reward) would those gamification pieces bring you back? Maybe, but probably not.</p>
            <p>All of this to say, make the main thing fun, whatever it is, then work on gamification.</p>

                    <p>Gamification is something I am incredibly passionate about so if you want me to write more about this please reach out and tell me!</p>
                    <p>I am having a ton of fun writing for all of you (and sorry about the grammar issues, I write this on an IDE, no spellcheck)</p>
                    <p>Cheers, have a great week,</p>
