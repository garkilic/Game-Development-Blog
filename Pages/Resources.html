				<p>This is a playlist of videos from Brackeys, a well known and highly respected teacher in the Unity tutorial space. This is a playlist of videos covering covering the basics of making a simple game and at the end, you will have your own game you can download yourself. The Unity version being used here is a little out of date, but it's the best tutorial playlist I have found so far.</p>
				<p>Amount of content: +50 hours</p>
				<p>Cost: Free</p>

				<p>This is another playlist of videos from Brackeys. This is a playlist of videos covering more advanced topics, specifically around making an FPS game in Unity. Once again, the Unity version being used here is a little out of date, you have been warned (and you got this!).</p>
				<p>Amount of content: 14 hours</p>
				<p>Cost: Free</p>

				<h2>After finishing these two playlists, lets start building our own 15 minute game ourselves (while Googling a ton), without any tutorials.
