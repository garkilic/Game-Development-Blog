			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<div>
				<p>I want to become a game developer.</p>
				<p>
					Last year I decided that I would finally learn to code, something I
					had always wanted to do. I started learning the basics of web
					development focusing on HTML, CSS, and JS. I found a lot of amazing
					resources (see: Scrimba) but I also found more "motivational" content.
				</p>
				<p>
					This content would have titles like "How I learned to code in 3
					months" or "How I would learn if I had to start over".
				</p>
				<p>
					While I imagine that the makers of this content had good intentions,
					it always struck me as simplistic, surface level, and unrealistic.
					Most people don't have the time or resources to code 8 hours a day.
				</p>
				<p>
					I decided that if I was ever in the position to learn something brand
					new I would document it from beginning so if anyone else wanted to
					know what it was like to learn that new thing, they could follow my
					real journey.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>
					So here we are, at the beginning of something new, my journey towards
					learning game development.
				</p>
				<p>
					I will be honest, game development never seemed like anything I would
					be interested in. Don't get me wrong, I love video games, but up until
					this point, video games were just a hobby.
				</p>
				<p>
					Last year, I started learning more about the world of VR and
					specifically, VR Chat. VR Chat was giving people of all backgrounds
					the opportunity meet new people, be their authentic selves, and live
					in a world free from the barriers they faced in their "real lives".
				</p>
				<p>
					Up until this point, I had really only focused on mobile and web
					applications in the fitness space as a Product Manager. VR seemed, at
					best, a fad to me. (It probably did not help that my one experience
					with VR was 10 years ago when I put on a giant "VR" helmet and felt
					like I was going to vomit).
				</p>
				<p>
					But, when I saw what this technology could do for other people, I saw
					its potential.
				</p>
				<p>And now, I am learning game development to build in the VR space.</p>
			</div>
			<h1>Why This Is Unique</h1>
			<div>
				<p>
					Let's be honest, I am not the first person to document learning
					something new. But, I think by following my journey, you can take
					something away, at least, I hope so.
				</p>
				<h3>
					So, what makes this a challenge or worth reading/following? What makes
					this different?
				</h3>
				<p>
					1. I have a full time job. For ~8 hours a day, I am working in IT at a
					local company where I live, so no unrealistic time commitments.
					Furthermore, I run every day in the morning and box three days a week
					in the evening, so my free time is even more limited.
				</p>
				<p>
					2. This is time-boxed. A year sounds short, but it really isn't. I
					learned web development in a year, so why not game development?
				</p>
				<p>
					3. I am no one special. I don't have excess time or resources. I work
					in technology, but even that isn't as unique as you might think. I
					just happen to stare at a computer more than most people.
				</p>

			<div>
				<p>Who knows, maybe this will be a total, overwhelming disaster.</p>
				<p>Whatever happens, I will document it here for you to read.</p>
